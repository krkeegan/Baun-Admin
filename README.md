# KRKeegan Fork

This is a fork from the original [Baun Admin](https://github.com/BaunCMS/Baun-Admin)
plugin.  I have added features that I find useful.  These include:

* User defined header keys as inputs in the 'simple' editor interface such as
'exclude_from_nav' or 'template'.  Keys are defined in the admin.php config
file.
