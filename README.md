# KRKeegan Fork

This is a fork from the original [Baun Admin](https://github.com/BaunCMS/Baun-Admin)
plugin.  I have added features that I find useful.  These include:

* User defined header keys as inputs in the 'simple' editor interface such as
'exclude_from_nav' or 'template'.  Keys are defined in the admin.php config
file.
* UI Fixes (Show nav drop down on small screens, better alignment of view, edit,
and delete buttons)
* Allow for user defined slugs in the simple editor.  Necessary to editing any
index page as discovered by [ivoilic](https://github.com/ivoilic/Baun-Admin/commit/db02f4f19200e903a192fe61e8e29cdf5419f999)
